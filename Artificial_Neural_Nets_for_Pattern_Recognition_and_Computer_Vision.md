### Computer Vision with Artificial Neural Networks a Primer 
#
### Research Notes Collated by : Rohit Dhankar

### Introduction :-   
Artificial neural networks are used to solve problems of pattern
recognition and computer vision.   

As ANN's are a higher level abstraction of complexity - they follow the basic Classification Logistic or Sigmoid functions.  
We should look at the Multiclass Logistic Regression with help of R , before we can understand ANN's .   
We shall code and implement ANN's with both R and Python.   
#
Some basic definitions :-   
```
Nodes => Artificial Neurons 



``` 
For ANN's all attribute values are to be provided between the Minimum 0 and Maximum 1 .  
Even Categorical and Ordinal variables have to be coded between Minimum 0 and Maximum 1 .  
For continous variables we apply the ``` min-max normalization```.
