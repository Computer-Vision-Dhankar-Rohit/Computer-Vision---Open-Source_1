# As seen below in our case 
# ELAPSED time - 1st 0.011 , 2nd - 0.012
# Thus the WALL CLOCK or REAL / ELAPSED 
# timings are almost same . 
#
# The USER TIME and SYSTEM TIME's in our case 
# add upto - 
# 1st - 0.008
# 2nd - 0.012
# Thus it would seem we are better off 
# with Vector Multiplication
# But we also need to consider 
# once we have the \"vec_gross_sale\" 
# we will need to add it to out \"mdf\"
# Kindly also note the Timings will
# differ for each system - also for each run 
# of the chunk of code on same sys
# Definition of user Time --- The ‘user time’ is the CPU time 
# charged for execution of user instructions of the calling process.
